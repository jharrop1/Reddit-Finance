I stopped at ‚ÄúA) not below a child‚Äôs IQ‚Äù get the fuck out you know damn well that is an impossibility here
IQ is Intelligence Quotient.  How smart someone is for their age.  Most children have an average IQ.
They move in tandem because they are shorted by the same hedgecuckfunds , so when one moves the others move. It can be because liquidity becomes an issue for them when one moves causing all to move or it could be a fault in the main algorithm they are using to short those meme stocks. A break in the codeing would apply over the board.
Quick google search yielded their correlation coefficient is .92‚Ä¶ which makes sense because, as you said, they are memes. 

Both of their company heads treat the company stock price like it‚Äôs a shitcoin. Doing whatever they can to pump it, and the vol.

Imo will stay that way until one of them does something fundamentally beneficial for the company, and not just rant on Twitter.
Big players with a lot of money. It‚Äôs not fundamentals is not a good stocks it‚Äôs just big players (hedge funds) pumping the meme stocks and then shorting them to make a huge profit
$MU
Because they have the same following. When one starts pumping, people start buying the others also.
Someone big wants to trap longs..
I know I‚Äôm asking for a lot.
Which is exactly why I‚Äôm not answering the question ü§°
That sort of aligns with the meme-stock-Moass-fuck-kens-ass-theory. I want someone who thinks that meme stocks are a ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù to give me a reason.

I appreciate your input though!!
Like a dividend split?
Same thing this sort of aligns with the overall theory. And would lead one to believe in Moass
What about it?

Edit: are the bags heavy?
‚ÄúHedgecuckfunds gave it away‚Äù
Great idea for the fundamental play that is AMC
Hahaha yeah this guy gonna lose a fortune
I don't even have a fortune to lose

If you are wonding what this is - its simple - it involves opening up another window and every 5 minutes building the fuck boy - and attacking invading pixels -  you can literally do it while losing money without spending any extra time.  But discord is important so you are not canibalizing fuckboy.  you get your name on every pixel you place until some asshole fucks with it - but if they dont everyone will know how great you are and how much you helped give back to the sub that has given so much to us all.  

Some call it their patriotic duty - its only until april 4.  The post at the top of WSB will give you much better information - im just trying to break through to the most retarded like myself. 

It doesn't matter how much of a fuck up you are - you are just the person we are looking for.  I'll be damned if some shitty sub shits all over fuckboy.  See you there.

Shout-out to those 6% thinking about climate.
According to biden non gender specific airport scanners should be at the top.
90% of the world don't trade stocks, bro.
We need more stock traders so we can call bullish on Target and Wendys
Most people don't consider the facts:

1. At least 50% of the world's population are kids. They don't trade.
2. 75% of the world are poor & uneducated. They don't trade.
3. Most people have real lives & jobs. They may invest, but they don't trade.

Apes teaching their children about how corrupt the game is will keep new generations out of the markets.

THE ONLY WAY TO ATTRACT NEW MONEY is if Wall Street grows a brain and levels the playing field with rules and laws that apply to everyone, including the hedge funds and all the other criminals that are stealing from retailers.
Well if mfs like Nike and Nestle use their children to make shit for them for 15 cents an hour, then we can easily get more traders. Bullish on this sub
Sweet gains, ape. Beat that fish handsomely.
Well that looks promising
Made me laugh
Nope to the moon we go brotha ü§£
Lambo where?
Hahaha this got me good
Ah the ole tinder strategy
Way ahead of you. I‚Äôm back waiting in line at the food bank. üòé
This analysis would‚Äôve made more sense back in January.

Just looking at GLNG, the stock is already up nearly 100% this year. I think valuations have indeed set in already so unless there is some new bet or information you think isn‚Äôt reflected, this is a Gain chaser in my mind.
Coming from a place of limited knowledge of this industry and trading, why would GLOP have 3 or 4 different stocks at different pricing?
Already in
Ruskies dont have to sell gas to Europe, they have by 2018 built twice as many pipelines to Asia as they needed and if they wanted they could funnel it all through them. additionally they have control over Syrian and Iranian oil/gas and their transport rights.

60-80% of central European gas comes from Russian pipelines. said countries do not have income to pay for liquefied gas which is 3 times the pipeline gas, and there are no pipelines to move that kind of volume from Germany to central Europe. also really how ecological its to move huge ships with gas across Atlantic?

there are also no processing capacities and wont be for another 5 years to replace majority of RU gas with liquefied gas

they have been accumulating computer numbers in exchange for their resources only for their reserves to be stolen. so now, they dont even need to do that. why sell resources if the money you get is useless. they only used the foreign reserves to repurchase their own currency, to prop it up, but now it seems they are doing it via reserve assets they have in China
It will take years to increase U.S. LNG export capacity. It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess where prices will be at in 2026 and beyond.
What do you think of $EURN ?
I still see considerable upside.  The recent analyst price target revisions have all been above $30/share with 13 out of 14 analysts have GLNG with a buy rating.   

So I respectfully disagree but time will tell, cheers.

This post is speaking to the common stock GLOP vs the other preferred share classes.  The Preferred stock has a much higher dividend but it has remained almost entirely flat and I don't see nearly as much upside to the preferred stock.

I personally don't see as much up side, but I don't necessarily see it as a bad stock.
Fantastic
Hahaha this guy cracks me up.
I watched this whole thing and was riveted the whole time. Hopefully you get nominated for an Oscar next year
yeah I don‚Äôt know about my current position right now. If this guy says I am fucked, I am fucked
I bought at opening.  Damnit
I heard dip
